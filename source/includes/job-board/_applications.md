## Submit an application

	<strong>IF BUILDING YOUR OWN APPLICATION FORM</strong><br>
	You can submit applications directly via our /applications POST method, and dynamically construct application forms for each job via the /job method's questions array. In general, we would encourage customers to make use of the embedded job application before going to the trouble of building their own form. Our application form is well tested, validated, battle hardened, and has built-in spam protection measures--building your own form can introduce a number of challenges which are typically not worth the additional effort.
